# Violent Crime Rates in the US in 1973

This presentation includes two plots illustrating the exploratory data analysis of base R’s `USArrests` dataset. This dataset includes the urban population percentage as well as the murder, assault, and rape arrest rates per 100,000 for each of the 50 US states. The data was used in conjunction with the `us.cities` dataset of the `maps` library, which contains information on states’ capitals.
